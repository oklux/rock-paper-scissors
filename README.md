Classic Rock Paper Scissors Game

I first had to create a Rock Paper Scissors game with JavaScript that could be played in the console. Then I had to add some more JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a playable version of it without the console. Everything was quite straightforward. For me the hardest challenge was to create the popup window after either player gets 5 points.

I haven't cleaned up the code so it might be a little messy.

Recommended to be played on desktop (chrome) and it should work in any sized window.
